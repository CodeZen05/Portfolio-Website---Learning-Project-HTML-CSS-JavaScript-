This is a personal portfolio website that I created for learning purposes. 
I followed a tutorial on YouTube (channel: Bing Bong Sand) to understand the structure and workflow of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in real projects. 
The channel is not available now, but I have learned a lot about page layout, styling, and basic interactivity through this project. 
This is not my original design; I recreated it only to practice and understand front-end development concepts.
